        <h3>Academic</h3>
        <p>My academic goals are centered around gaining comprehensive knowledge and expertise in the field of computer engineering, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence. I plan to pursue this specialized path at ENSAS, where I believe the curriculum and research opportunities will provide a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of AI. I am eager to deepen my understanding of machine learning, data analysis, and intelligent systems, as these are rapidly growing areas that are shaping the future of technology.
<br>
In addition to my studies at ENSAS, I aim to participate in a double degree program in France, specializing in cybersecurity. This will allow me to expand my skill set and gain international exposure, learning about the latest security challenges and solutions from leading experts in the field. I see cybersecurity as an essential complement to artificial intelligence, as both areas are increasingly interconnected in protecting digital systems and data.
<br>
Beyond formal education, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. I plan to undertake various training courses, workshops, and certifications that will enhance my technical skills and keep me updated on emerging technologies. These additional qualifications will not only strengthen my expertise but also prepare me to adapt quickly in a fast-evolving industry.
<br>
Ultimately, my academic journey is designed to equip me with the knowledge, experience, and credentials necessary to become a top expert in my domain. I am driven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving, and I want to contribute meaningfully to advancements in AI and cybersecurity. Through dedication and hard work, I aim to excel academically and position myself as a leader who can make a significant impact in the technology sector.</p>
