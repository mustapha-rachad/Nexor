      <h1 class="custom-text">About Me</h1>
      
      <p>My name is Mustapha Rachad. I was born on September 24, 2006, and I am 18 years old. I come from Casablanca, Morocco — a city full of life, culture, and history that inspires me every day. Currently, I am studying engineering, a discipline that captivates me because it combines creativity, logic, and practical solutions to real-world challenges.
<br>
Since childhood, I have been curious about how things function and why they work the way they do. This curiosity has fueled my passion for engineering and motivated me to continually improve my skills and knowledge. Beyond my studies, I am a person driven by passion and dedication. I love football and billiards, two sports that challenge me mentally and physically and teach me the importance of focus and strategy.
<br>
I have a deep affection for my city and my country, which shape my identity and values. I am proud of my roots and committed to giving back to my community. Traveling is another passion of mine — I enjoy exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and broadening my horizons. The ocean, with its vastness and tranquility, holds a special place in my heart; it reminds me of both the beauty and mystery of the world.
<br>
All these experiences and interests have shaped me into an eager learner who is ready to face new challenges and make a meaningful impact wherever I go.</p>

          <h4>Stone Age</h4>
             </div>
        <div class="outside-text1">
            <p>During my childhood, I experienced a life filled with joy and love, thanks to my wonderful parents. They are the reason behind all my success, constantly encouraging me from a very young age and guiding me toward my goals. Their unwavering support has been a driving force throughout my life. Since my time in kindergarten, I have always excelled in all my classes, demonstrating a strong commitment to learning and personal growth from the very beginning.
<br>
However, despite this happiness, I also faced many difficulties and challenges growing up. Financial struggles and family issues created obstacles, and at times, my mother and I felt a sense of unfairness or discrimination. Yet, through it all, our faith remained strong. We believed that God was above all and that with determination and trust, we could overcome any hardship. This belief gave us the strength to push forward, and thanks to perseverance and support, we succeeded.</p>

          <h4>Iron Age</h4>
          </div>
        <div class="outside-text2">
            <p>During what I like to call my “Iron Age,” I continued to excel academically, consistently achieving top marks in all my studies. Education has always been a priority for me, and I took great pride in maintaining high performance across all subjects. This dedication to my academics laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors.
<br>
At the same time, I was also very active in sports, particularly as a passionate player of football and billiards. I was fortunate to be part of several teams that helped me grow both physically and mentally. Among these teams were L'Étoile de la Jeunesse Sportive, Avadas, and Racing Club Athlétique. Playing with these clubs not only honed my skills on the field but also taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, discipline, and leadership.
<br>
Balancing rigorous studies with demanding sports activities was challenging, but it helped me develop excellent time management skills and resilience. These experiences shaped me into a well-rounded individual, ready to take on challenges with determination and a positive attitude.</p>

          <h4>Middle Age</h4>
         </div>
        <div class="outside-text3">
            <p>During this period of my life, I experienced some of the most stressful moments I have ever faced. Despite the pressure, I managed to achieve outstanding academic results that I am truly proud of. I earned the top grade in my regional class, scoring an impressive 18.15 out of 20, and later achieved 16.33 out of 20 in my Baccalauréat with a specialization in Physical Sciences and Biology (option PC Biof). These accomplishments were the result of hard work, perseverance, and focus during challenging times.
<br>
I would like to sincerely thank my mother, father, and my aunts for their unwavering support throughout this period. Your love and encouragement have been my greatest strength. I love you all deeply.
<br>
In addition to my academic success, I had the opportunity to travel abroad, visiting Turkey and England. These journeys broadened my horizons, exposed me to new cultures, and enriched my personal growth. Balancing rigorous studies with international travel was demanding, but it helped me build resilience and adaptability, qualities that continue to guide me today.</p>

        <div class="outside-text4">
            <p>The modern age of my life marks an important turning point, as this is when I began my journey into engineering. It was the moment I took the very first step toward the career I had dreamed of since childhood. Studying engineering has been both challenging and inspiring, fueling my passion for innovation and problem-solving.
<br>
During this period, a new passion entered my life — motorcycles. The thrill, freedom, and precision involved in riding quickly captured my heart and became an important part of who I am.
<br>
This stage also brought exciting travel opportunities. I had the chance to visit Qatar and Thailand, experiences that enriched my understanding of the world and introduced me to diverse cultures and ways of life. These travels, alongside my studies and growing interests, have shaped me into a more open-minded and driven individual, ready to pursue my goals with determination.</p>
