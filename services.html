      <p><br>In 2022, I went on my first trip outside of Morocco with my family — a memorable journey to Istanbul, Turkey. It was an unforgettable experience, filled with discovery, joy, and breathtaking scenery.
<br>
One of the first places we visited was Eminönü, a vibrant area full of life, where the air was filled with the scent of freshly baked simit and the sounds of ferries crossing the Bosphorus. We also had the chance to eat at the famous Buraq Restaurant, where the delicious Turkish dishes left a lasting impression on us.
<br>
A highlight of our trip was visiting the Princes’ Islands, known for their peaceful atmosphere and beautiful beaches. There, I rented a bicycle and explored the charming streets, surrounded by nature. The fresh sea breeze and stunning views made it feel like a dream.
<br>
We also went to Ortaköy, where I watched the magical sunset over the Bosphorus — one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. While there, I tried the famous baked potato of Ortaköy, loaded with toppings and full of flavor.
<br>
Another exciting part of the trip was visiting Vialand, a large amusement park that was full of fun and adventure for the whole family. It was the perfect way to end a trip filled with both cultural discovery and entertainment.
<br>
My trip to Istanbul was truly special, and it gave me a deep appreciation for the beauty and culture of Turkey. I hope to return someday to explore even more.</p>

            <p>During my time at BCA, I attended daily English classes focused on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The teachers were supportive and engaging, creating a dynamic classroom atmosphere that made learning enjoyable and effective. I also participated in group discussions and interactive activities that helped me gain more confidence in using English in real-life situations.
<br>
The campus provided a great environment for both learning and making new friends from different parts of the world. Outside of class, we joined cultural excursions and social events that allowed us to discover more about British culture, traditions, and daily life in London.
<br>
At the end of my studies, I received a diploma from Ardmore, a recognized certificate officially accredited by the UK authorities. This diploma represents not only the progress I made in English, but also the unforgettable experiences I had during this journey.
<br>
My time at BCA was truly enriching, both academically and personally. It gave me the tools to continue improving my English and opened the door to new international opportunities.</p>

            <p>In England, I had the chance to explore four very different and interesting cities. London was full of life, with famous landmarks like Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. I walked along Oxford Street, visited museums, and loved the multicultural atmosphere. It felt like a city full of energy and opportunities.
<br>
In Windsor, the atmosphere was more peaceful and elegant. I visited the impressive Windsor Castle and enjoyed walking through the charming streets and along the River Thames. It felt very traditional and truly British.
<br>
Oxford was rich in history and knowledge. I explored the beautiful university buildings, visited famous colleges, and spent time in quiet gardens and old bookstores. The academic environment made me feel inspired and curious.
<br>
Reading had a modern and comfortable vibe. I enjoyed the shopping centers, parks, and riverside walks. It was a friendly, student-focused town where I felt at home. The mix of city life and calm spaces made it a great place to relax and explore.</p>

            <p>Throughout my stay in England, I enjoyed many unforgettable experiences. I visited Madame Tussauds in London and was amazed by the realistic wax figures of celebrities, world leaders, and superheroes — it felt like walking through a world of fame and history. At Buckingham Palace, I saw the royal guards in their traditional uniforms and walked through the peaceful, historic gardens near the majestic palace.
<br>
Windsor Castle was another highlight, with its stunning towers, grand halls, and historical rooms. I learned a lot about the British royal family and enjoyed the beautiful views from the castle grounds. In Oxford, I explored the historic university and its impressive library filled with ancient books, which left me feeling inspired and curious.
<br>
Playing football with English teams was a fun way to connect with local students and share the spirit of the game. I also spent time in Reading, where I visited local shops, relaxed in parks, and enjoyed the town’s mix of modern life and English charm.

      <p><br>During my trip to Thailand, I had a layover in Doha, Qatar, which turned out to be a surprising and unforgettable part of my journey. I landed at Hamad International Airport, which is often ranked as the best airport in the world — and I quickly understood why. The airport was incredibly spacious, clean, and beautifully designed, with modern architecture and a calm, luxurious atmosphere. I was especially impressed by the art installations, including the famous giant teddy bear sculpture in the terminal. Everything was high-tech and efficient, from the security process to the information screens and lounges. It felt less like an airport and more like a high-end shopping mall or a five-star hotel.
<br>
Since I had a few hours before my next flight, I took the opportunity to leave the airport and explore Doha. The city was both modern and elegant, with stunning skyscrapers and wide roads. I visited the Corniche, a beautiful waterfront promenade with views of the Persian Gulf, and admired the skyline that sparkled in the sunlight. I also got a glimpse of traditional Qatari culture in places like the Souq Waqif, where the architecture, colors, and local shops gave me a sense of the country’s heritage. Although my time in Doha was short, I was amazed by how clean, safe, and organized everything was.
<br>
This brief stop in Qatar allowed me to experience a unique mix of futuristic development and rich culture. It definitely made my journey more exciting and gave me a desire to return one day to explore even more.</p>

        <div class="outside-text1">
            <p>In Phuket, I experienced a perfect mix of adventure, nature, and fun. I started with a visit to the famous Patong Beach, where the white sand, clear water, and vibrant atmosphere made it a great place to relax and enjoy the sun. In the evening, I went to Illuzion, one of the top nightclubs in Phuket. The lights, music, and live performances created an exciting and unforgettable night out.
<br>
For adventure, I took a trip to Phang Nga where I went white-water rafting through a beautiful jungle river. The fast rapids and stunning scenery made it a thrilling experience. I also went on a quad bike ride through muddy trails, hills, and forest paths — it was both exciting and a great way to explore the landscape.
<br>
One of the highlights of my trip was spending time with elephants. I got to feed them, play with them, and even help bathe them in a river. It was a touching and unforgettable experience to be so close to these gentle animals. I also visited the Monkey Temple, a peaceful and spiritual place surrounded by nature, where I saw monkeys roaming freely around the temple grounds.
<br>
Phuket gave me so many amazing memories, combining relaxation, nightlife, adventure, and unique cultural experiences all in one.</p>

        <div class="outside-text2">
            <p>Bangkok helped me to discovered a fascinating mix of culture, shopping, and excitement. I started by visiting ICONSIAM, one of the most impressive shopping malls I’ve ever seen, with luxury stores, a beautiful indoor floating market, and a great view of the Chao Phraya River. I also went to the famous Maeklong Train Market, where vendors quickly move their stalls as the train passes right through — it was incredible to watch and truly unique.
<br>
I explored some of Bangkok’s most iconic temples, including the Temple of the Reclining Buddha (Wat Pho), where the massive golden Buddha left me speechless. I also visited the Big Buddha (Wat Paknam), an enormous statue that stands tall over the city and offers a peaceful, spiritual atmosphere.
<br>
One of the highlights was visiting the Floating Market, where I saw colorful boats selling fruits, food, and souvenirs on the water. The energy and charm of the market made it a really fun experience. In the evening, I went to the Octave Rooftop Bar, where I enjoyed amazing panoramic views of the city skyline while relaxing in a stylish setting.
<br>
To top it all off, I watched a live Muay Thai match at Rajadamnern Stadium. The energy of the crowd, the tradition behind the sport, and the intense action in the ring made it an unforgettable night.
<br>
Bangkok offered an amazing mix of tradition, modern life, and unforgettable moments — a city full of life and surprises.</p>

         </div>
        <div class="outside-text3">
            <p>Krabi became my favorite city ,because I explored some of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. I started in Ao Nang, a lively beach town with stunning views, soft sand, and a relaxing atmosphere. From there, I took boat trips to several breathtaking islands. I visited the Hong Islands, known for their crystal-clear waters and peaceful lagoons, as well as Ko Lao Lading, a small island surrounded by dramatic cliffs and turquoise sea — truly a hidden gem.
<br>
Chicken Island was another unique spot, named after its rock formation that looks like a chicken's head. I also stopped at Phra Nang Beach, a spectacular place with soft white sand, caves, and impressive limestone cliffs rising from the sea. Each island had its own charm, and the natural beauty everywhere was simply unforgettable.
<br>
One of the most memorable parts of my trip was climbing to the Tiger Cave Temple, located at the top of a mountain. The hike was long and challenging, with over 1,200 steps, but the view from the top was absolutely worth it. Surrounded by mountains and jungle, the temple felt peaceful and powerful, and the effort to reach it made the experience even more rewarding.
<br>
Krabi was full of adventure, nature, and serenity — a paradise that left me in awe at every turn.</p>

          <h4 class="lavishly-yours-regular">Phi Phi Island</h4>
         </div>
        <div class="outside-text4">
            <p>On Phi Phi Island, I had some of the most unforgettable experiences of my entire trip. One evening, I went kayaking during sunset — the sky turned orange and pink over the calm sea, creating a peaceful and magical atmosphere. Later that night, I joined the beach crowd to watch exciting fire shows with fun competitions that got everyone involved. The energy was amazing and the night was full of laughter and entertainment.
<br>
One of the most unique things I did was participate in a Muay Thai match at the island’s small stadium. It was intense, fun, and gave me a deeper respect for the sport. But the highlight of my time in Phi Phi came the next morning, when I went scuba diving at Maya Bay. It was, without a doubt, the best activity of my life. I swam alongside sea turtles, reef sharks, and many colorful marine creatures. The underwater world was breathtaking — calm, vibrant, and full of life.
<br>
To end my stay, I treated myself to a traditional Thai massage, which was the perfect way to relax after all the adventure. Phi Phi Island marked the final stop of my solo trip in Thailand, and it was the perfect ending to what became the best journey of my life. I fell in love with all of Thailand — its nature, culture, and people made a lasting impression on me.</p>
